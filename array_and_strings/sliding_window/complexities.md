## Dynamic Window Size

```
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++):
        Do some logic to "add" element at arr[right] to window

        while WINDOW_IS_INVALID:
            Do some logic to "remove" element at arr[left] from window
            left++

        Do some logic to update the answer
```

## Fixed Window Size

```
function fn(arr, k):
    curr = some data to track the window

    // build the first window
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        Do something with curr or other variables to build first window

    ans = answer variable, probably equal to curr here depending on the problem
    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++)
        Add arr[i] to window
        Remove arr[i - k] from window
        Update ans

    return ans
```

## Efficiency

For any array withe length `n`, there are 

1. `n` subarrays of length 1
2. `n - 1` subarrays of length 2
3. `n - 2` subarrays of length 3
...
4. `1` subarray of length `n`

The total number of subarrays is:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

A sliding window algorithm guarantees a maximum of $2n$ window iterations. The right pointer can move at most `n` times, and the left pointer can move at most `n` times. This means that if the logic inside each window iteration is efficient, $O(1)$, then the total time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n) + O(n) = O(2n) = O(n)$.

This algorithm employs a `for` loop and a nested `while` loop. At first glance, the presence of these loops might suggest a quadratic time complexity, $O\left(n^2\right)$. However, due to the specific behavior of the `while` loop, the actual complexity is linear, $O(n)$. This is because the `while` loop's total number of iterations across the entire algorithm is capped at $n$, not $n$ per for loop iteration.

```
for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++):

    Do some logic to "add" element at arr[right] to window

    while WINDOW_IS_INVALID:

        Do some logic to "remove" element at arr[left] from window
        left++
```

The overall complexity of the algorithm is $O(n)$, not $O\left(n^2\right)$, because the key insight of amortized analysis is recognizing that high-cost operations in some iterations (e.g. `while` loop runs $n$ iterations for a single iteration of the `for`) are balanced by lower-cost operations in others (e.g., for all other iterations of `for`, the `while` will not run at all), leading to a lower average cost per operation across the algorithm's total runtime.

# Length of Longest Subarray

 Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to `k`. 

## Time Complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n)$, because the operations inside the `for` loop and the `while` loop are $O(1)$.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant because we are only using integer variables to store the left and right pointers, the sum of the current window, and the maximum length of the subarray.

# Length of Consecutive 1's Single Flip

Given a binary string s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0" and flip it to a "1". Find the length of the longest substring achievable that contains only "1". Another way to look at this problem is to find the longest substring that contains at most one 0. 

For example, given `s = "1101100111"`, the answer is 5. If we flip the element at index 2, the string becomes "1111100111".

Considering this problem as finding the longest substring that contains at most one 0 makes it easy to solve the problem with a sliding window. The constraint metric and numeric restriction combined to be `window.count("0") <= 1`. We can use an integer variable to keep track of how many "0" we currently have in our window.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is amortized $O(n)$, because the operations inside the `for` loop and the `while` loop are $O(1)$. The while loop will run at most `n` times across the entire algorithm, not `n` times per iteration of the `for` loop.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant because we are using only integer variables to store the pointers, the count of zeros in the current window, and the maximum length of the subarray.

# Subarray Product Less Than K

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

For example, given the input `nums = [10, 5, 2, 6]`, `k = 100`, the answer is `8`. The subarrays with products less than k are:

```
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
```

In the context of the sliding window algorithm, for a current window defined by indices `(left, right)`, the number of valid sub-windows that end at index `right` is determined by the position of the `left` index. Given that the window can be adjusted to start from any index between `left` and `right` inclusive, the total number of valid windows ending at `right` is equal to the length of the window, calculated as `right - left + 1`. This accounts for all possible starts from `left` to `right`, including the window consisting of just the element at `right`.

## Example 1

- Array: `[4, 7, 1, 2, 5]`, examining window ending at index `4` (`right = 4`).
- `left` can range from `0` to `4`, inclusive.
- Total valid windows ending at index `4`: `5` (`right - left + 1` = `4 - 0 + 1`).
- The valid windows are: `[4, 7, 1, 2, 5]`, `[7, 1, 2, 5]`, `[1, 2, 5]`, `[2, 5]`, `[5]`.

## Example 2

- Array: `[2, 1, 5]`, examining window ending at index `2` (`right = 2`).
- For window ending at index `2`: `3` (`right - left + 1` = `2 - 0 + 1`).
- The valid windows are: `[2, 1, 5]`, `[1, 5]`, `[5]`.

## Time Complexity

Again, because the work in each loop iteration is amortized constant $O(1)$, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input array.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant because we are using only integer variables to store the pointers, the product of the current window, and the count of valid subarrays.

## Largest Sum of Subarray with Length K

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the sum of the subarray with the largest sum whose length is `k`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$. The first loop to construct the fist window is $O(k)$, and the second loop to slide the window is $O(n - k)$. The total time complexity is $O(k) + O(n - k) = O(n)$.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant because we are using only integer variables to store the pointers, the sum of the current window, and the maximum sum of the subarray.

---

## Largest Average of Subarray with Length K

Given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`. Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$, since the two loops at most iterate through the entire array $O(k) + O(n - k) = O(n)$.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant for the same reasons as the previous examples.

---

## Length of Consecutive 1's with K Flips

Given a binary array `nums`, you can perform at most `k` flips. Return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array after performing at most `k` flips.

## Time Complexity

Similar to the problem where we can flip at most one zero, the time complexity of this algorithm is amortized $O(n)$. The operations inside `while` is $O(1)$, and the total number of iterations across the entire algorithm is capped at $n$, not $n$ per iteration of the `for` loop. 

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant for the same reasons as the previous examples.

## Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

### Approach using Sliding Window (Dynamic Window Size)

Initialize `left` pointer to `0` and `curr_sum` to `0`.
Iterate over the `nums`:
- Add `nums[right]` to `sum`.
- While `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`:
  - Update `window_len` = `min(window_len, right - left + 1)`, where `right - left + 1` is the size of the current window. This means that the left index can safely be incremented, since the minimum subarray starting with this index with `curr_sum â‰¥ target` has been achieved.
  - Subtract `nums[left]` from `curr_sum` and increment `left`.
  
### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n)$; we iterate through `nums` using the `for` loop. The `while` loop inside can run at most `n` times. Each element is visited at most twice, once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is constant since the variables we use do not change with the size of the input.

## Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

### Time Complexity

#### Python

In python:

1. We have a $O(n)$ operation to convert the string to a list of characters.
2. The first loop to construct the first window is $O(k)$.
3. The second loop to slide the window is $O(n - k)$.
4. The set operation to check if a character is a vowel is $O(1)$ average.

Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n) + O(k) + O(n - k) = O(n + k + n - k) = O(2n) = O(n)$.

#### C++

In C++:

1. We have a $O(z)$ operation to create a set of vowels, where $z$ is the number of vowels.
2. The first loop to construct the first window is $O(k)$.
3. The second loop to slide the window is $O(n - k)$.

The total time complexity is $O(z) + O(k) + O(n - k) = O(z + k + n - k) = O(z + n) = O(n)$.

### Space Complexity

Outside of the variables and pointers we use, the space complexity is determined by the space used to store the vowels.

#### Python

The space complexity of the set used to store the vowels is $O(z)$ where $z$ is the number of vowels. We also use a list to store the characters of the string, which is $O(n)$. The space complexity is $O(n + z)=O(n)$.

#### C++

We use a boolean array to store the vowels, which is $O(z)$. Finally, unlike python, we can iterate over the string without converting it to a list, so the space complexity is $O(z)$, which is essentially $O(1)$.
